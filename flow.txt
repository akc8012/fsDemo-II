Current:
  0. Ship is flying
        MovementReversePlayback -> Recorder.On()

  1. Ship gets WHACKED
        PlayerCollider -> OnTriggerEnter()

  2. Ship pauses
        PlayerCollider -> DoDelayedCartReset()

  3. Ship reverses back to checkpoint
        PlayerCollider -> Movement.MovementEvents.Go() -> StartMovementReverse() -> MovementReversePlayback.PlaybackReversed()

  4. Ship resumes flying
        MovementReversePlayback -> ScriptToggler.On() + Recorder.On() + [if ShouldResetMovements:] MovementReseter.Load()

Desired:
  0. Ship is flying
        MovementPlayback -> Recorder.On()

  1. Ship gets WHACKED
        PlayerCollider -> OnTriggerEnter()

  2. Ship pauses
        PlayerCollider -> MovementEvents.StartReversePlayback() -> MovementPlaybackOrchestrator.Playback() [event sent to all] -> MovementPlayback.PauseShip()

  3. Ship reverses back to checkpoint
        MovementPlayback -> PlaybackReversed() -> PlaybackFinished [event, recieved by orchestrator]

  4. Ship resumes flying
        MovementPlayback -> ScriptToggler.On() + Recorder.On() + [PlaybackFinished: when ALL are recieved] MovementPlaybackOrchestrator.Finished -> MovementReseter.Load()



We need:
  MovementPlaybackOrchestrator single + static
  MovementPlayback on each like now


Events:
  PlayerCollider.OnTriggerEnter ->
    MovementEvents.StartReversePlayback() ->
      MovementPlaybackOrchestrator.Playback() ->
        [Model]  MovementPlayback.PauseShip() -> MovementPlayback.PlaybackReversed() -> MovementEvents.PlaybackFinished()
        [Camera] MovementPlayback.PauseShip() -> MovementPlayback.PlaybackReversed() -> MovementEvents.PlaybackFinished()
          MovementPlaybackOrchestrator.Finished() [called when ALL playback finished are recieved] ->
            MovementPlayback -> ScriptToggler.On() + Recorder.On()
            MovementReseter.Load()

  Might not need the Orchestrator: Try doing all of this just in MovementEvents?

  PlayerCollider.OnTriggerEnter ->
    MovementEventOrchestrator.StartReversePlayback() ->
      [Model]  MovementPlayback.Pause() -> MovementPlayback.PlaybackReversed() -> MovementEventOrchestrator.PlaybackFinished()
      [Camera] MovementPlayback.Pause() -> MovementPlayback.PlaybackReversed() -> MovementEventOrchestrator.PlaybackFinished()
        MovementEventOrchestrator.Finished() [called when ALL playback finished are recieved] ->
          MovementPlayback -> ScriptToggler.On() + Recorder.On()
          MovementReseter.Load()
