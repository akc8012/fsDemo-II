Intellisense for VS Code Unity:



Verify that DOTween is working/needed:
  It uses a .dll so.... (shrug)


// FIXED
----JSON parse error:
      an error with pro-builder
      it needs a json config file
      it came in empty from our repo
      it tried to auto-refill, but we killed it
      lets see if filling it back in fixes it

Obj ref with pro-builder:
  Don't think this is breaking anymore? Need another build...
