Don't forget controller from work!!

The Great Refactor (2019):
  ----Make sure all inputs are working (PlayerMovement.cs)
  ----Whitespace / Weird spacing
  ----Do we need ProBuilder??
        Env cubes seem to be using it
        Not REQUIRED(?) it seems, but nice to have
        Built into Unity now, lets not mess with it


----Intellisense for VS Code Unity:
  GOTTEM!
  I didn't have mono installed, and you can't use flatpak app with VS Code

---- Verify that DOTween is working/needed:
  It uses a .dll so.... (shrug)
  Yup! It works! (somehow)

----JSON parse error:
      an error with pro-builder
      it needs a json config file
      it came in empty from our repo
      it tried to auto-refill, but we killed it
      lets see if filling it back in fixes it

----Obj ref with pro-builder:
      Don't think this is breaking anymore? Need another build...
