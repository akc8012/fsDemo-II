Don't forget controller from work!!

The Great Refactor (2019):
  ----Make sure all inputs are working (PlayerMovement.cs)
  ----Whitespace / Weird spacing
  ----Do we need ProBuilder??
        Env cubes seem to be using it
        Not REQUIRED(?) it seems, but nice to have
        Built into Unity now, lets not mess with it

How It Works:
  PlayerMovement:
    Controls the plane within *2D screen-space*
    Cannot pass screen boundaries
    Rotates around to follow a point based on input
    IMPORANTLY: Does not control forward motion, and overall rotation!! This is done by the `Cinemachine Smooth Path`
      If you turn off the PlayerMovement script - plane still moves FORWARD and ROTATES along track, just do not have screen-space movement!!
  CameraFollow:
    Handles *screen-space* camera movement based on player
    Does not move camera forward OR rotate camera!! This is done by Cinemachine
    Actually *extends* player movement boundary, but is still clamped
    When CameraFollow is turned off, player still moves around 2D screen-boundary, but camera does not follow on screen-space


----Intellisense for VS Code Unity:
  GOTTEM!
  I didn't have mono installed, and you can't use flatpak app with VS Code

---- Verify that DOTween is working/needed:
  It uses a .dll so.... (shrug)
  Yup! It works! (somehow)

----JSON parse error:
      an error with pro-builder
      it needs a json config file
      it came in empty from our repo
      it tried to auto-refill, but we killed it
      lets see if filling it back in fixes it

----Obj ref with pro-builder:
      Don't think this is breaking anymore? Need another build...
