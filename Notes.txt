Don't forget controller from work!!

The Great Refactor (2019):
  ----Make sure all inputs are working (PlayerMovement.cs)
  ----Whitespace / Weird spacing
  ----Do we need ProBuilder??
        Env cubes seem to be using it
        Not REQUIRED(?) it seems, but nice to have
        Built into Unity now, lets not mess with it
  DOTween as new-fangled Unity package?

How It Works:
  PlayerMovement:
    Controls the plane within *2D screen-space*
    Cannot pass screen boundaries
    Rotates around to follow a point based on input
    IMPORANTLY: Does not control forward motion, and overall rotation!! This is done by the `Cinemachine Smooth Path`
      If you turn off the PlayerMovement script - plane still moves FORWARD and ROTATES along track, just do not have screen-space movement!!
  CameraFollow:
    Handles *screen-space* camera movement based on player
    Does not move camera forward OR rotate camera!! This is done by Cinemachine
    Actually *extends* player movement boundary, but is still clamped
    When CameraFollow is turned off, player still moves around 2D screen-boundary, but camera does not follow on screen-space

Triggers (Player Collision):
  Each scene cube has a mesh (FOR SOME REASON) collider, non-trigger
  Player has trigger box collider and rigidbody
  OnTriggerEnter is called ONCE on enter and ONCE on exit
    This is not a problem for us, since we'll only ever enter once, quickly

CinemachineDollyCart:
  Position is a float that tells along the CinemachineSmoothPath we are
    0 is reset to start
  *For testing: We can set Speed to 0 and change position to test the track!!!*

Reverse:
  We'll need to *disable* PlayerMovement and dolly camera track movement while the Reverse script is going
  (We should have a script called Reverse, that's cool)


----Intellisense for VS Code Unity:
  GOTTEM!
  I didn't have mono installed, and you can't use flatpak app with VS Code

---- Verify that DOTween is working/needed:
  It uses a .dll so.... (shrug)
  Yup! It works! (somehow)

----JSON parse error:
      an error with pro-builder
      it needs a json config file
      it came in empty from our repo
      it tried to auto-refill, but we killed it
      lets see if filling it back in fixes it

----Obj ref with pro-builder:
      Don't think this is breaking anymore? Need another build...
